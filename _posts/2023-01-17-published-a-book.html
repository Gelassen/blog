            I faced with a necessity to develop an education process and platform which 
            will solve existing issues I see now at front of me. In the middle of 2020 
            I released a concept and platform of collaborative education (freezed at 
            this moment)[1] and in September of the passed year I wrote and published several
            notes which was organised in the small book. [2]

            I gave it a name "What I would like to tell to my son".

            This publication does not have intent to transmit all my knowledge and 
            experience, but intends to bridge the gap in things which I lacked off in 
            system\collectives I lived in, worked with and evolved. It defines its 
            necessity and, perhaps, demand. I says 'perhaps' because now it is already 
            a new time and a new world which creates its own new requirements.
