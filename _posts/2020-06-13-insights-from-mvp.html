            This week I gathered first feedback on introduced MVP
            https://lnkd.in/dSqfQj8<br /><br />
            
            I made a hypothesis the problem I work on is relevant for students who entered university to get fundamental knowledge & market valuable skills and teachers/tutors/coaches who are currently work with them.<br /><br />
            
            I built my interview based on questionnaire from one popular Product Manager (t.me/productclub). The general schema was:<br /><br />
            
            1. Which is step by step scenario how do you currently solve this issue?<br /><br />
            2. What do you keep in mind when you make decision? What is the trigger for one or another scenario?<br /><br />
            3. What kind of problems you are faced with?<br /><br />
            4. Goals, motivations, causes<br /><br />
            
            I ended with list of interesting discoveries where I want to emphasize this points:<br /><br />
            
            As an Engineer who worked on systems that highly relying on community I would predict enourmous amount of work on creating and nurturing community<br /><br />
            
            As a Teacher/Tutor/Coach I would not manually create course in system, instead I would prefer to answer questions from motivated students<br /><br />
            
            As a Teacher/Tutor/Coach I doesn't have enough spare time to contribute into the system<br /><br />
            
            It gave me idea to pivot and integrate with existing communities like stackexchange or yandex.ru/q and next step is initiate discussion with them.<br /><br />
