        Do we really understand others people or just simply try to fit them 
        into stories we created? <br><br> 

        Why for Swedes is important to seek consensus? <br>
        Why French are ready to spend hours to find a Good bakery? <br>
        Why Japanese like ambiguity in language and avoid to say 'no'? <br><br>

        Do we really understand others people or just simply try to fit them 
        into stories we created? Does reality even exist? <br><br>
