        Do we really understand others people or just simply try to fit them 
        into stories we created? <br><br> 

        Why for Swedes is important to seek consensus? <br>
        Why French are ready to spend hours to find a Good bakery? <br>
        Why Japanese like ambiguity in language and avoid to say 'no'? <br><br>
        
        I wrote about different universes each of us lives in (https://goo.gl/rHhBfY) <br>
        I wrote about trap of confirmation bias (https://goo.gl/BVqeah) <br>
        I wrote about conclusions based on incomplete information and how 
        to communicate issues (https://goo.gl/T3JTSo) <br>
        I wrote about roles of biology and world view in understanding of human 
        behavior (https://goo.gl/cS2xUX) <br><br> 
        
        Do we really understand others people or just simply try to fit them 
        into stories we created? Does reality even exist? <br><br>
