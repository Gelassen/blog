        The root cause of the conflict is scarcity. We move into conflict 
        situation when there is not enough something for everyone - 
        material resources, opinions about the Truth, decision regarding 
        what to do next etc. <br><br> 

        Therefore if we want gracefully resolve the conflict we have to 
        generate more value or/and decrease our expectations. <br><br> 

        The issue is there is still a limit on how much we can decrease 
        our expectations and how much value we are able to generate. <br><br>
