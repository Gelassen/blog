        <h1>Executive summary</h1>
        <p>
            Passed week I have been working on repairing electronics of 
            household appliances. I repaired 4 items which generated ~7000 
            rubles for a business. <br><br>
            
            Meanwhile I learned about how this household appliances are 
            designed and work and what are their typical issues are. The 
            publication is about this. <br><br> 

            The cost of the service is calculated near 10%-20% to make it 
            attractive to both client and business. 
        </p>
        <h1>The cost calculation</h1>
        <p>
            Worth to note a few things about the cost calculation. Seven years 
            ago I already <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2017/04/25/how-I-learn-how-to-sell-my-and-my-team-services.html">published</a> 
            we have to focus on RoI when do sales of our products or services, 
            <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023/11/22/why-do-you-need-to-setup-ssdlc.html">another publication</a> 
            shown how much business is ready to pay to mitigate potential 
            losses caused by breach in their information security. The same 
            approach is relevant here, the cost of the service is ~10%-20% of 
            the cost of a new product, except relatively cheap devices which 
            diagnostics and repair work cost nearly the same as the cost of a 
            new device.
