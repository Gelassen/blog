            This week I implemented second version of mobile application that provides access to russian government data such as bills, deputies, hearings. <br /><br />

            It includes new features such as: <br />
            - search by bills <br />
            - voting details <br />
            - deputies who spoke on hearings <br />
            - stenogramm of hearings <br /><br />

            Next steps are to learn more about coroutines lifecycle, cover codebase with tests as there were a new architecture was implemented and gather user feedback. <br /><br />
