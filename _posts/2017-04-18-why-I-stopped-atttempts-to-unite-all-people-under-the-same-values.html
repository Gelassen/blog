        Dear friends and colleagues, <br><br>

        Two years ago I made a courage step in unknown to follow what I believe in. 
        It was a beginning of amazing journey: I saw a lot, I did many new things 
        and made many mistakes. Finally I learned from them and understand many new 
        things I didn't aware of early. <br> 
        For those I inspired -- I don't believe anymore in universal truth and 
        vision. This world became much more complex and diverse; disagreement and 
        conflict followed by change leads to a new stable state and this is 
        inevitable part of movement forward. Now I keep what is important for some 
        group of people and me just for ourselves and make a step back to let 
        others shine with their own ideas and visions. <br> 
        For those I brought issues -- thank you for your support and patience to 
        my growth, thank you for supportive environment where I can do something, 
        make mistakes and learn from this. <br><br> 
        
        
        It is something marvelous to share this today when we-Christians celebrate 
        Easter as in some way it is the death of me old and the birth of me new. 
        Happy Easter! <br><br>
