            This week I had a talk with prospective client and make a proposal which should increase
            her sales and new customers on ~25% based on data we had. Below is ideas and methodology of
            the implementation.  
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">The idea</h3> 

        <p>
            Based on my data (Russian market, 2019) the market of online purchases is quite big (~50% 
            from all market) and <a href="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/get-bunker/128809/c1ad7137a1e20f30d9e3d53cad958b242e320a98/orig">continues to grow</a>, 
            ~30% of customers purchase goods over mobile devices and <a href="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/get-bunker/128809/fbb6f8c9fb2d578052ed80a9ceb4a28a20f21145/orig">their market share continues to grow</a>. 
            It becomes crucial to have digital sales channel both on desktop and mobile sides where 
            customer can view goods in one click, in two clicks - make an order, in three clicks - 
            pay for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case of my potential customer she has few stores which sells flowers. Here is the top 
            3 reasons to implement it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, it seems to be the fastest way to make an order: mobile cell phone is always in 
            a pocket, application from the company I trust is already installed and I can make an order 
            in 3 clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, it could motivate a client to make an order. You are familiar with SMS 
            notifications and notifications from others applications. Our mobile app also could 
            send a notification a day before event to remind a client he or she might want to
            buy a bucket of flowers (8th of March, 14th of February, Day of Mother, 1st of 
            September, 31th of December etc)     
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it can give you an excellent advertisment. Let's say the day after receiving 
            flowers we ask a happy customer to write a postiive recommendation into the social network and 
            as an appreciation for feedback we give him or her a 15% discount on the next order.   
        </p>

        <p>
            How is it interesting for business owner? How to analyse it? 
        </p>


        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Discovery phase</h3> 

        <p>
            Despite on a great power of analytics only response from end users will give the most 
            complete understanding of how right you are. In this case a talk with business owner 
            or her representative was a next vital step in the disovery phase.   
        </p>
        <p>
            What I was looking for is key business metrics of her business, plans for growth and 
            current issues. For key business metrics I use key metrics from unit-economy: user 
            acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLV) and conversion rate (C1)  
        </p>
        <p>
            During our talk and interview I got answers on the many of my questions, some was left 
            unresolved because some business data just is not recorded, also another valuable 
            extra information was popped-up.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Without mentioning exact numbers I got understanding about average purchase receipt, average 
            amount of purchase receipt for average month, monthly expenses on marketing, percent of customers 
            attracted by this marketing efforts and conclusion the majority of customers came 
            naturally, without expenditures on marketing. Big percentage of customers comes online, 
            from social networks. Conversion rate was not available and I offered general 1 from 10. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Extra information was referred to issues business is faced at this moment. It was 
            reaching plateau in obtaining new customers as the most of the current customers are 
            the same people who returns to the shop again. Another issue was many clients are not 
            tech-savvy or feels reluctant to install new app even if it promise them to give
            benefits cashback system (customers complains about lack of storage space on their 
            devices). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The last interesting point from our talk was cashback system is used by her business. This 
            cashback system is just a part of one interesting product. This product also offers a 
            mobile app which out of the box covers 2 of 3 features I mentioned at the begining. It seems 
            to be there is no reason to implement custom app, however there is still the reason to go 
            with custom solution.   
        </p>
        <p>
            This product has one drawback which might be crucial. It is designed for business in general 
            and covers variety of different businesses. It means unification of business processes, it 
            means ignoring some unique aspects of each business, it means ignoring valuable information 
            from local market. All of this might be reasons behind your success of failure. That's why 
            implementing custom mobile app is still a valuable option.  
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">The analysis</h3> 

        <p>
            The first question we have to answer is regarding reaching plateau in acquiring new 
            customers. Does it mean there is no space for growth because business reached the majority 
            of the market? (this chain is not in the big city). It is an issue to find out data 
            for the local market, but general analytics should fit too. If we trust 
            <a href="https://s0.rbk.ru/v6_top_pics/resized/590xH/media/img/3/21/754888165246213.png">this</a> 
            data from <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/business/07/03/2017/58bd68479a7947ffc224a695">this</a> 
            source, then we should have a good capacity for growth.    
        </p>
        <p>
            The next question is how does mobile app impact business metrics? How does it solve 
            the issue with acquiring new customers and which gains it bring?
        </p>
        <p>
            What is important for us is our monthly burn rate (gross) - expenditures on acquiring 
            new customers including fixed costs to run the business, - should be less rather 
            than revenue customer brought after the first and next orders.       
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's calculate the customer acquisition cost (CAC). It is done by dividing our 
            monthly customers on monthly budget on the marketing. We got the value X which is our customer 
            acquisition cost. However, business owner said only part from monthly users came 
            due marketing activities which means it should be included in our calculation. 
            Now it looks as "our monthly customers" * "percent of customers gained due marketing" 
            / "monthly budget on marketing" which gives our CAC. Furthermore, we based our 
            calculations on users who made an order which should be only part from amount of 
            people who noticed the advertisement. Early we agreed on conversion rate in 10%. 
            The final formula to calculate the CAC is (("our monthly customers" * 
            "percent of customers gained due marketing") / "conversion rate (0.1)") 
            / "monthly budget on the marketing".  
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's calculate now revenue from new customers we expect. It just multiplication  
            of the "average purchase receipt" on the "amount of new customers". From our data above 
            near half of client's target audience wants to make purchases online, near third of 
            them wants to do this via mobile devices, total customer base reached by marketing 
            activities was evaluated too. It should be 25% customers increase compared to current 
            client's amount of customers. By multiplying this new customers on average purchase receipt 
            we get information about expected revenue after running the mobile app. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Viral effect from recommendations from mobile app in social networks should be explored in 
            another topic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By having data about others expenses for running business, we could evaluate the 
            profit that should be brought by launching mobile app and consequently return on 
            investment in development.   
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">The conclusion</h3> 

        <p>
            This model was built on data from business of my prospective client, from analytics of 
            trusted sources, and part of data were assumed based on experience. The more accurate the data, 
            the more effective the forecast and the quality of the decisions made. This is one of the 
            reasons why development of software products often done by iterations (~2 weeks) - it is 
            necessary to validate the formulated hypothesis as soon as possible with minimal investment.
