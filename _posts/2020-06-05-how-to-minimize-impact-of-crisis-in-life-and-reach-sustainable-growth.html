        How to minimise impact of —Årises in life and reach sustainable growth? I spent some time to learn from experience of others and reflect on it to apply to my life. <br /><br />

        The world around us is constantly changing. Some of this changes we can notice and be prepared, some of changes become unexpected. Some of them bring loss, some of them bring benefit. <br /><br />
        
        
        How to plan your life in situation of change and uncertainty? <br /><br />
        
        
        The only thing we can control and change it is just our own behavior. That's why our plans should be built around it without relying on external factors. <br /><br />
        
        I look at my past and recognise what were successes and what were fails. I look for factors that helped me and factors that brought harm. I increase first of them and start avoid second. <br /><br />
        
        We learn from feedback-mistakes, but not all information that we gain is correct or understand correctly. That's why it is important to see the signal over noise to learn right lessons and develop right habits. <br /><br />
        
        The planning is essential, but doesn't work well as nobody can really predict the future. It still has value and to make it better I think about what has happened in my past and what might happen in the future -- this thoughts help to adjust plans to the better. <br /><br />
        
        Planning is nothing without execution. At the same time we overestimate things we can do in long run and underestimate things we can do in short run. That's why it is important to apply regular efforts in one direction with focus on your short and long goals. <br /><br />
        
        We learn through feedback. I try to find time each week to reflect on past week, measurement of my progress helps to spot what can be done better. <br /><br />
        
        I analyzed how companies become autonomous and I experiment with applying their approach to my life and our community (How we work). At the same time open and effective market is a solution to many problems and I moved to contract-project based work. <br /><br />
        
        We don't live in future, the life happens now. It is important that hard work doesn't kill not only productivity, but others aspects of life. Keeping balance on weekly basis allows personal & professional growth, don't ruin health and be happy with life. <br /><br />
