        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            A week ago I worked on the project which aim was to build a drone from ordered 
            accessories and write own or flash existing firmware. It was not a project 
            for a potential customer, but research's milestone results and gained expertise 
            might be interesting for my readers.   
        </p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>
            It was a new domain for me and, at the first, the project required a R&D phase. 
            At the discovery phase we have to answer a set of questions necessary to the 
            success of the project. This questions had been stated in the online document 
            and the tech doc had been shared with the group. When key questions had been 
            answered, a picture of what should be done became more or less clear. The 
            next step should be to launch a pilot project to check the result of the research.  
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <h4>Firmware</h4>
        <p>
            Market analysis shown a variety of different existing solutions. The most 
            promising was the Ardupilot. <br> <br>

            Ardupilot <a href="https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Copter/stable/">supports</a> 
            a quite big set of hardware <a href="https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html#common-autopilots">suppliers</a>, may be they even have 
            some kind of partneship agreement. In case project woud have new requirements 
            to the hardware which outscope officially supported by the Ardupilot, 
            existing Ardupilot codebase could be a good staring point to make a fork and 
            write our own customised firmware version. <br> <br>
            
            The market also has other systems and solutions. Of course, it is also possible to 
            write our drone's firmware from scratch, but it will require an order of magnitude 
            more resources, that's why to check existing solutions at first is important.   
        </p>
        <h4>Hardware</h4>
        <p>
            The most important part of drone hardware is a pilot controller. Ardupilot supports 
            many models, but at this stage CUBE orange was checked <br>
            <a href="https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005005003735399.html?sku_id=12000031312517604&spm=a2g2w.productlist.search_results.2.2e514aa6o7xK1K">Reference on the sample at the aliexpress.</a> 
            <br><br>
            On the image below the rest of drone's components are shown (CUBE compatible, one of the options) <br>
            <p>
                <img src="/blog/assets/images/cube-hardware-compatible-list.jpeg"/>
            </p>
        </p>
        <h4>The problem of compatibility of the flight controller and the Remote Controll (radio transmitter directly in the hands)</h4>
        <p>
            Research phase revealed RC usually developed for specific drone and supplied by manufacturer. 
            There is a cross-compatibility issue. However, the main problem is in the frequency and protocol 
            used. According to the <a href="https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/remote-control-and-pilot-controller-compatibility/98062">discussions</a>, multi-protocol controllers are compatible with a large number 
            of flight controllers / drones. <br><br>

            Althought top drone's models on the market has extra layers of security to prevent 
            hijacking and some other issues. <br><br>
            
            This issue requires extra research, but at this stage we could go further with 
            multi-protocol support radio controller like 
            <a href="https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-hall-radio-controller

            ">TX16S Hall Radio Controller</a>

        <h3>Post Scriptum</h3>
        <p>
            Research phase helped to rised up and clarified questions to build a drone. The next 
            pilot phase should help to verify assumptions and come to production ready solution. 
            At this moment the further work has been hold on due the decisions to go at first 
            by the different way. The current tech doc is avaialble by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WgitYAnTEcGtN1k8gPY6BUpVtkGZJvxc-uoXbCFgYc/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>.
