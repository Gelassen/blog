        Being comfortable with engineering and management roles, sales was 
        Terra Incognita for me. Learning how to sell our services our team 
        got three insights. <br><br> 

        Focus on return of investment. There are many forms how we can bring 
        value to our customers, but finance success commonly is the most 
        important as it is a vital part of the business. By shift a talk from 
        the cost of our services to how much money our customers can earn or 
        save by investing in our project, we discuss what is really important 
        for our customers. If ROI is positive then start project makes sense. <br><br>
        
        Let people know you and what you do. Instead of practicing cold 
        calling we are focused on organizing events, speak on external events 
        and publishing case studies about our experience. We let people know 
        about us and where we are good at, let them a chance to know each of 
        us as a person and make a decision do they want to work with us or 
        not before sign any contracts. Then when our potential customers 
        discover demand in IT solutions they will know at least one vendor 
        with whom they would like to work with. <br><br> 
        
        It is possible to stay humble. When you tell people where your team/you 
        are good at, it is not about you -- it is about the value you can bring 
        to your customers success and contribution to common good of society. <br><br>
