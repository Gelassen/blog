        High performance team needs a psychological safety and I have to admit it 
        is true. <br><br> 

        On a biological level we have several layers of brain which scientists 
        explain evolved with time. The most recent one is neocortex which is 
        responsible for our major thinking processes. Under severe stress ancient 
        level of brain responsible for instincts start to dominate and suppress 
        neocortex with our rational thinking processes. For me, as a software 
        engineer, it means drop in my ability to solve problems and write code. <br><br> 
        
        Since I left corporate world level of uncertainty grown a lot and forced 
        me to quickly learn new techniques how to stay productive in all our 
        activities under stress <a href="https://goo.gl/rAbdvK">https://goo.gl/rAbdvK</a> <br><br>
        
        I mentioned here <a href="https://lnkd.in/gqYmEZT">https://lnkd.in/gqYmEZT</a> 
        to run a company/business the first thing we should track is available 
        cash with some buffer on future. Coderbunker offers our clients retainer 
        contracts where our clients transfer budget at the beginning of a month 
        and get back unused money at any time when they want to stop work.  
        My personal experience working under different scheme shown delay with 
        payments or mess in processes take attention from major work. <br><br>
        
        There is still a space for experiments. <br><br>
