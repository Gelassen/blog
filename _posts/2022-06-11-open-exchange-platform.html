            This week I finished MVP for open exchange platform. The idea behind project is to allow people who have 
            resources or services in demand on the market exchange them with each other without money. It is old known 
            barter with support of new technologies.

            Money was a next step in economic relationships of the mankind. Unfortunately economic system has evolved in 
            the state when they are quite often abused: threats from certain power groups to shutoff from world economic
            system, banks loans under interest higher than percent of GDP growth, living in debt by just printing dollars.

            or <a href="https://darudar.org/page/ideology/mission/?language=en_US">gift economy</a> such as "Darudar" are 
            interesting alternatives that should have place. This platform is another attempt to fill the gap in the world.

            After deployment alpha version allows to create person offers&demands and match with requested 
            resources&services offered by others. Next steps in development would be increasing matching accuracy
            and exploring blockchain tech stack to the benefit of the project.
