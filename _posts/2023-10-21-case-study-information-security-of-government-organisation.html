            Executive summary
        </h3>
        <p>
            Over passed week I explored domain of information security applied to 
            a state organization like children hospital and prepared a list of 10 
            steps to do to establish a foundation of organization's information 
            security. Meanwhile I met with several tradeoffs which is not resolved 
            yet and require tight work with several key persons/organizations 
            around this issue. <br><br>  

            The potential client is the children state hospital in a provincial city 
            in Russia. A new year-old Russian law obligates each government organization, 
            including hospitals, to establish, maintain and evolve information security 
            of the organization. Due our talk I was asked to help them to implement 
            and maintain it. <br><br> 

            Discovery stage of work included investigation of key law documents. 
            Based on them comprehensive, but not yet complete list of questions 
            had been prepared to get the most complete understanding of the issue. 
            Further research covered search of answers based on my own experience, 
            experience of narrow experts and industry's best practices in Russia 
            and worldwide. <br><br>  

            Work on this issue shown some things should be done centralized - 
            besides this state hospital there are more hospitals in city and 
            even more others state organizations who are affected by this law. <br>
            Another thing to consider this law obligations are not diversified 
            much depends on organization's size and budget -- compliance with 
            all law requirements can become an unbearable burden for a small 
            hospitals. All this had been considered in the proposed solution. <br><br>  
            
            It is important to draw attention to look at proposed solution as 
            a first iteration which will evolve in time based on experience 
            gained with implementation of this steps and changes in treats from 
            external world.  
            
            Technical doc with all details and proposed solution is available by this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5rsPHeZxWQBJhtGp9Cvmmt8uqOtLY4BW5jhmMjOxuk/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>

        <h3>
            Discovery
        </h3>
        <p>
            <h4>
                Which laws are relevant for this scope?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Bill №250 (указ №250) and bill №1272 (постановление правительства 
                РФ №1272) are main bills for this scope shared with me with 
                hospital's representatives. Research shown hospitals are categorized 
                as a critical informational infrastructure which is regulated 
                by a separate <a href="https://zlonov.ru/kii/">package of bills</a>. <br><br>
                
                Recent a new order №213 by Federal Security Service complement 
                bill №250. <br><br>
                
                Obviously a law about personal data №152 also should be taken 
                under consideration. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                What is a criteria of organization's information security?
            </h4>
            <p>
                There is no common metrics to verify organization's information 
                security. <br><br>
                
                Common sense tells the main criteria is to prevent a malicious 
                user to get remote access to organization network and systems 
                to steal or corrupt data and get down organizational informational 
                infrastructure. <br><br>
                
                A couple of information security officers shared FSB check law 
                papers organization had prepared to confirm compliance with 
                law's requirements and your set of measures to mitigate malicious 
                intrusion and possible denial of service. <br><br>

                Recent order №213 gives a clue FSB will start automatic or manual 
                penetration testing of organization in addition to this measures.  
            </p>
            <h4>
                What are requirements to information security officer?
            </h4>
            <p>
                There are many of them, but it is important to emphasis this ones: <br><br>

                1. Law requires formal education in one of the centers authorized 
                by the government.   <br><br>

                2. Experience in penetration testing: to build secure infrastructure 
                you have to know how to hack it first. <br><br>
                
                3. Experience in creating legal papers. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                How to organize training for staff?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Many attacks not just involves technical actions, but also 
                actively uses social engineering - work with regular employees 
                to get unauthorized access with their help. That's why set of 
                measured taken to establish and maintain organization's 
                information security should include work with employees in 
                addition hardware and software parts. <br><br>

                The following set of methods is proposed for the first iteration 
                of corporate training: <br><br>
                
                - Creation and subsequent distribution of video presentations 
                among employees of the organization that provide them with 
                the knowledge they need in the field of information security 
                (frequency once a month) <br><br>
                
                - Analysis of cases emulating information security incidents 
                to develop the necessary theoretical ideas about the necessary 
                steps in the area of responsibility of each employee 
                (frequency every three months) <br><br>

                - Carrying out activities that emulate information security 
                incidents to develop the real skills of each employee in 
                his/her area of responsibility in the field of information 
                security (frequency once every six months) <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>
                What should be used as a foundation of building organization's 
                information security?
            </h4>
            <p>
                In my opinion it is results of penetration testing where tools 
                like Burp suite will help a lot and comprehensive OWASP testing 
                guide. <br><br>

                It worth to note we have to be careful with international joint 
                initiatives and institutions. In many cases it is always better 
                to use a power of a whole world rather than efforts of just 
                single country or even groups of countries, but unfortunately 
                such initiatives and institutions are often used as an instrument of 
                global politics against country's interests and security (e.g. 
                credit ratings).  
            </p>
            <h4>What else left?</h4>
            <p>
                Technical document covers many others aspects which are not 
                included into this publication. The tech. doc is available 
                by this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5rsPHeZxWQBJhtGp9Cvmmt8uqOtLY4BW5jhmMjOxuk/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>

        <h3>
            Solution
        </h3>
        <p>
            Decree No. 250 covers the entire list of state organizations, 
            regardless of their size and available budget. However, the 
            implementation of measures aimed to ensuring information security 
            must take into account the available state organization's budget, 
            so that these measures do not become an unbearable burden. 
            Hence, a conflict is possible between the information security 
            system built in the organization and the requirements of 
            regulatory/supervisory authorities. <br><br>

            The main method of testing the state of an organization's information 
            security should be penetration testing. Perhaps it makes sense 
            instead of hiring an individual in the government organization 
            (to each hospital), agree on regular penetration testing by a 
            third party for the entire city-district. This will provide an 
            opportunity to attract more highly qualified specialists and reduce 
            the overall costs for all government organizations (in this case 
            hospitals) of the city. <br><br>

            Thus, the required minimum measures for a children's city hospital are: <br><br>
            1. Organization of penetration testing for the purpose of stealing 
            documents (data) and system failure. <br>
            2. Organizing a DDOS attack (an attack on an organization’s systems 
            leading to system failure). <br>
            3. Based on the results of this testing, drawing up recommendations 
            for the organization to eliminate vulnerabilities and the necessary 
            training for the organization’s employees. <br>
            4. Implementation of measures to eliminate vulnerabilities. <br>
            5. Drawing up a test for knowledge of information security fundamentals, 
            taking into account the results of previous penetration testing, 
            for employees of the organization. <br>
            6. Testing the organization's employees for knowledge of information 
            security basics. <br>
            7. Training of employees of the organization, taking into account 
            the result of previous penetration testing. <br>
            8. Repeated testing of the organization's employees for knowledge 
            of the basics of information security in order to understand 
            whether the training at the fifth step gave any results, and 
            how the training needs to be adjusted to get the desired results. <br>
            9. Preparation of legal documents confirming that the organization 
            complies with the requirements of laws in the field of information 
            security (Decree No. 250, Russian Government Decree No. 1272, No. 152, 
            and everything related to the cue) <br>
            10. Repeat as necessary (at least once a year) <br><br>

            The city children's hospital is included in the list of critical 
            information infrastructure (CII). The legal requirements for CII 
            were formulated much earlier than Decree No. 250 and it is assumed 
            that the hospital has already implemented these requirements. <br><br>

            In the case of a conflict with regulatory and inspection authorities, 
            it is necessary to expand the list of measures above to the required level. <br>
            It is worth noting that this list of measures already in this form 
            conflicts with Decree No. 250 and Government Decree of the Russian 
            Federation No. 1272, that the official responsible for the 
            organization’s information security, by signing this document and 
            limiting himself only to it, comes into conflict with the current 
            legislation - breaks the law. <br>
            However, full compliance with the law places a heavy burden on the 
            organization and budget - also an extreme that must be avoided. 
            A possible solution should be sought in negotiations with a lawyer and 
            the city administration.
