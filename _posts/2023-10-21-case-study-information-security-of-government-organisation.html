            Executive summary
        </h3>
        <p>
            Over passed week I explored domain of information security applied to 
            a state organization like children hospital and prepared a list of 10 
            steps to do to establish a foundation of organization's information 
            security. Meanwhile I met with several tradeoffs which is not resolved 
            yet and require tight work with several key persons/organizations 
            around this issue. <br><br>  

            The potential client is the children state hospital in a provincial city 
            in Russia. A new year-old Russian law obligates each government organization, 
            including hospitals, to establish, maintain and evolve information security 
            of the organization. Due our talk I was asked to help them to implement 
            and maintain it. <br><br> 

            Discovery stage of work included investigation of key law documents. 
            Based on them comprehensive, but not yet complete list of questions 
            had been prepared to get the most complete understanding of the issue. 
            Further research covered search of answers based on my own experience, 
            experience of narrow experts and industry's best practices in Russia 
            and worldwide. <br><br>  

            Work on this issue shown some things should be done centralized - 
            besides this state hospitals there are more hospitals in city and 
            even more others state organizations who are affected by this law. <br>
            Another thing to consider this law obligations are not diversified 
            much depends on organization's size and budget -- compliance with 
            all law requirements can become an unbearable burden for a small 
            hospitals. All this had been considered in the proposed solution. <br><br>  
            
            It is important to draw attention to look at proposed solution as 
            a first iteration which will evolve in time based on experience 
            gained with implementation of this steps and changes in treats from 
            external world.  
            
            Technical doc with proposed solution is available by this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5rsPHeZxWQBJhtGp9Cvmmt8uqOtLY4BW5jhmMjOxuk/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>
