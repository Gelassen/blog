            Inspired by Sunlight Labs this week I was working on mobile app with access to russian government data such as bills and their details, hearings, deputies. <br /><br />
            
            The intent is to create a channel of what is going on in our State Duma to inform interested parties as business representitives, community activists and journalists with future plan to extend it to feedback loop and platform for discussions. <br /><br />

            First version offers: <br />
                - see all introduced bills and their details <br />
                - see list of deputies <br />
                - track favourite bills to keep an eye on important decisions <br /><br />

            Tech stack: <br />
            Android, Kotlin, Kotlin Coroutines <br /><br />
