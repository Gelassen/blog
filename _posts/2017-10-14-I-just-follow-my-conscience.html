        Some people call me as a chess player or person without a plan on life, 
        but what I do is just follow my conscience and serve aims greater than 
        I am. However the one who gave me conscience is indeed a superior to 
        all masters in chess. <br><br>

        I do mistakes, big and small, but they are inevitable on path of 
        learning, doing something new to change things to the better. <br><br> 
        
        For a while I was driven with idea to build a society according to my 
        vision how things should work. I believed we can unite all people under 
        same values, I believed we can do this by patience to mistakes and 
        creating opportunities for thinking, reflection and enlightenment. This 
        world become much more complex and diverse, life proved me I can't rely 
        only on my own views and views of people from my sandbox. I have to be 
        more humble, seek for contribution of wider groups of people and listen 
        more. <br><br> 
        
        It moved my focus, I found my new mission in professional and personal 
        development. Markets are responsible for civilization and everything I 
        learned for the passed year shown me all my efforts in six years in IT 
        were applied in the wrong direction (*), but may be that's what we call 
        experience, isn't it? <br><br>
