        This week I celebrate 1 year on freelancing as many who starts 
        business doesn't reach this milestone. It is time to make a 
        summary. <br><br>

        I invested 35k RMB in this initiative. After taxes, Coderbunker 
        fees and expenses to run operations here I earned 160k. 28k is 
        on my balance in China right now. (rate is under NDA with my 
        client)(*) <br><br>
        
        My burn rate is near 10k where 7.5k is fixed cost. Bottom line 
        is 8k - the cost of ticket to home (my finance obligations I do 
        my best to pay upfront). 20k was the cost to start, in total 
        loss was 24k loss. Coderbunker takes 10%, tax rate varies depends 
        on how I receive money. The longest delay in payment was 45 days. <br><br>
        
        During this time I worked on 3 projects. The shortest was 2 weeks, 
        the longest would be 6 months. Through Coderbunker and my personal 
        network I established relationships with 10 people who might be 
        interested in my expertise. I did dozen of meetings for initial 
        consultation, few hackathons and several public speaking events. 
        Made weekly linkedIn updates as a part of marketing activity. <br><br>
        
        The focus on next year is to increase value I bring to my customers. <br><br>
