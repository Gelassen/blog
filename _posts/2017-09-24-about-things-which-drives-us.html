        Human behavior is based on two things - biology and world view. On a DNA 
        level we are all different, this defines our physical parameters, our 
        chemistry and our preferences. Our biology is a basis of our behavior. <br><br> 

        However we also have a mind and that's what is distinguish us from apes 
        (by version of Darwinists). Our mind with necessary training (education) 
        is able to create more sophisticated forms of behavior. It is able to 
        regulate our biology and change our reactions. That's what makes complex 
        biology driven behavior even more sophisticated. <br><br> 

        To understand others people we have to understand their biology and 
        world view. <br><br>

        What kind of things has impact on our mind? I think the right answer 
        would be science, religion and philosophy. <br><br> 

        In situation of uncertainty I look at people ideals and values, models and 
        concepts they believe in which they use to adjust their behavior. <br><br>
