            Intro
        </h3>
        <p>
            The field of healthcare & life science is especially interesting to me 
            because it plays a very important role in our lives, there are many 
            problems and opportunities that need to be solved, and the solution 
            of which will have a significant positive impact on society as a 
            whole. <br><br>

            Last week during a search for a new contract I offered one company in 
            this field several relevant problems and potential solutions to 
            deliver to the market based on three years of my work with doctors in 
            my spare time.   
        </p>
        <h3>
            Ideas
        </h3>
        <p>
            <h4>
                The issue of doctors extreme overload with paperwork 
            </h4>
            <p>
                The issue is doctors spent big part of their job on preparing 
                papers required by variety of organisations. It is already 
                exceeds time they spend on treating patients, usually requires 
                them to work on weekends and holidays even without payment 
                for this time. <br><br>

                Possible solution is to fill required standard forms and other 
                templated-based documentation by voice (machine learning, voice 
                recognition), maximize amount of pre-filled templates for the 
                most of cases for patients (database creating and gathering 
                data, generative AI)
            </p>
            <h4>
                The issue of medical diagnosis 
            </h4>
            <p>
                The issue is a human body is sophisticated system which takes 
                8 years to learn and 10 years of relevant practice to become 
                a good doctor (Russia). However even good doctors have a right 
                to make mistake. That's why an issue to make right medical 
                diagnosis and following treatment is open and relevant. <br><br> 

                Possible solution could be: <br><br>

                a. Gather database of patients medical history (complaints,
                symptoms, initial examination results, blood tests, diagnostics 
                results, treatment results) by hospitals (possibly it would be 
                better to start from the the most experienced doctors). <br>
                b. Based on this database create and expert system in a form of 
                symptoms â†’ possible options of diagnosis and treatment; the more 
                primary data came to the system (blood tests etc.), then the more 
                narrow down possible options of diagnosis become. <br>
                c. With a help of applying machine learning on database and usage 
                experience, heuristics of system could be improved. <br><br>
                
                The system in any meaning doesn't replace a real doctor and does 
                not take a responsibility to make a diagnosis. It justs help a 
                doctor to narrow down possible options (diagnoses, treatment 
                methods, drug therapy) be leverage the best practices of doctors 
                from a whole country (or even the world, if private and 
                government clinics of other countries will be added to the system)
            </p>
            <h4>
                The issue of existing digital document management software quality 
                and the issue to duplicate this paperwork in traditional forms 
            </h4>
            <p>
                At least on the level of Belgorod region, official digital document 
                management system on government hospitals and clinics should be 
                better: <br><br>

                1. Doctors have to deal with many bugs in the system (~50 bug 
                reports per day, source: sys. admin from one clinic in Stary 
                Oskol), some of them are critical for continue work with the 
                system. <br><br>

                2. This together with some hardware & network issues push doctors
                to duplicate documents on paper by their hands. This system 
                didn't make their paperwork easier, but made it even more difficult 
                and time consuming. <br><br>
                
                Traditionally healthcare domain is strictly regulated by the 
                government with all associated troubles. Offer an 
                alternative solution without administrative resource is 
                difficult if not impossible. <br><br>
                
                Possible solution should take under consideration current 
                vendor relevant issues which are unknown for me, but just 
                share with them best practices and possible solutions on issues 
                I had observed, I have not received any feedback. <br><br>
                
                This data is year old. If nothing has changed to the better, 
                there is an business opportunity to deliver on market superior 
                digital document management system for government hospitals and 
                clinics.
