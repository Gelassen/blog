        <h3>About the problem</h3>
        <p>
            Near a month ago I got an issue from a small family business owner 
            and a last week I was able to do a research regarding it. <br><br>

            It is an offline shop which also has a website. The current issue is 
            the entrepreneur could not delegate processing online orders to a 
            separate person, therefore sometimes due operational overload online 
            orders have not been processed on time. <br><br>
            
            At this moment the issue temporarily has been solved by disabling online orders. <br><br>
            
            We have to think about possible solution. Based on the market research,
            near 50% of customers do purchases online - online sales channel 
            <cursive>*potentially*</cursive> could double business revenue. 
        </p>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <h4>Get more information about the business</h4>
        <p>
            It was a small talk and I didn't get enough information necessary to 
            going further. My next step was to check a source of code of their 
            website to get any information about platform they use to run their 
            shop. <br><br>
            
            The source code shown the shop is based on the Woocommerce.  
        </p>
        <p>
            How to make sure you would not lost orders which come from the 
            website? <br><br>

            Assuming you are using smartphone which is always with you, it would 
            be good to redirect online orders to yours or your employee's 
            smartphone. My next steps were to check what kind of integration 
            options the Woocommerce offers to its clients.  
        </p>
        <h4>Options of 'Woocommerce - smartphone' integration</h4>
        <p>
            Woocommerce supports integration with instant-messaing app 'telegram'. 
            Telegram has been chosen because of it popularity on the business's 
            target market. According to my preliminary research, plugins support 
            is available in Woocommerce premium account.

            Woocommerce supports plugin for sending sms to customers and to the 
            shop admin. In particular, it is possible to receive a notification 
            about a new order. At this moment it costs 100 USD per year and works 
            in integration with other plugins, which total price is topic for 
            extra research. Knowing the annual orders based on past years and 
            assuming the online sales channel <cursive>*potentially*</cursive> gives 
            an increase in revenue by x1.5-x2 times, it is possible to esimate 
            the return on investment in further work with this option. <br>

            Woocommerce also has an official mobile app and a variety of third 
            party mobile apps. I haven't dive deeper into this direction, but it 
            looks like there's also an option to get notifications on your phone 
            for every new order. <br><br>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            In case my initial assumptions were right - shop is based on the Woocommerce 
            and the business owner or his employee actively uses smartphone - 
            there are variety of options to return back the online sales channel 
            without extra finance overhead of hiring a new employee. <br><br>
            
            The results has been shared with the business owner. <br><br>
