        After many projects failures and many successes I understand the real 
        goal isn't meet deadlines, isn't deliver all scope of features, isn't 
        deliver within the budget -- the only thing what's matter is when 
        your users love your product and when stakeholders return enough on 
        their investments. That's real definition of done we should pursue, 
        pleased stakeholders is a wrong objective.
