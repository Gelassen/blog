        Passed several weeks I have been working on the platform to meet drivers with passengers. Similar to blablacar.

        <br></br>

        With the next step of the global agenda people have to wear a digital id (e.g. QR code) to have access to things that yesterday were an essential part of their daily routine like access to the public transport. Fight for their rights push them to self-organise over social media and solve the issue with their own resources. Some media starts call them "clean blood community".

        <br></br>

        My idea was to help them by offering the platform where they could match each other needs in more convenient way rather than they do now.

        <br></br>

        This is the first release of this open car share platform.
