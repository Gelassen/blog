        Many years ago from Adizes lectures I learned about company lifecycle 
        and challenges company faced with on each stage of its growth. <br><br>

        It always reminds me about two important things. <br><br>
        
        Everything which is alive has problems, we can not really avoid them 
        -- only choose which one we will deal with. If so it would be good to 
        do not compromise on our values and beliefs and make actions according 
        to them. <br><br>
        
        The only constant in our lifes is change. Change in us or outside 
        environment and we have to learn how to embrace it and be comfortable 
        with it. <br><br>
        
        Be open for change and do not compromise on your values&beliefs.<br><br>
