        The root cause of the conflict is scarcity. We move into conflict 
        situation when there is not enough something for everyone - material 
        resources, opinions about the Truth, decision regarding what to do 
        next etc. <br><br> 

        Therefore if we want gracefully resolve the conflict we have to 
        generate more value or/and decrease our expectations. <br><br>

        The issue is there is still a limit on how much we can decrease our 
        expectations and how much value we are able to generate. <br>

        Values define our focus, our priorities, about what we care more and 
        what less. That’s why in situation of decision making (situations of 
        scarcity) we align them to our values — every ‘yes’ we say at the same 
        time means ‘no’ to someone or something. Our values determine decisions 
        we will make in conflict situations, situations of choice. <br><br> 

        Common values help reach an agreement in groups, but at the same time 
        create boundaries - they draw a line what we as a group encourage, what 
        tolerate and what we discourage. In this way values are borders and 
        that’s what define not only persons as individuals, but a whole nations 
        and cultures. <br><br>

        The question is does any culture superior than another one? If no, how 
        to deal with culture (subculture) which is in many aspects antagonistic 
        to ours? How to solve issues that happen when country open their borders? <br><br>

        Just thinking. <br><br>
