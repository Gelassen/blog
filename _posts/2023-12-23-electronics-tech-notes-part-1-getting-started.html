        <h3>
            Intro
        </h3>
        <p>
            Past month I have been diving into electronics and this publication 
            opens a seria of notes on this topic. <br><br>

            It covers repairing 'Siemens SITOP power 20' power supply and based 
            on this explains basic foundation elements and principles of 
            electrics and electronics. <br><br>

            Disclaimer: standards which regulates electric voltage in common 
            wires and some other things are different from region to region. 
            In this publication I will use standards used by Russia and the 
            rest post-Soviet countries.

        <h3>
            First overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            First overview of the power supplier didn't show any damages caused 
            by fire or blasts. People who brought this to our laboratory claimed 
            there were some blast, fire and smoke inside. <br><br>

            <p>
                <img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-12-23/siemens-sitop-power-bottom.png"/>
            </p> <br><br>
            
            Next step was checking key elements of the power supplier on current 
            resistance with help of a multimeter. It also didn't show any issues. <br><br>
            
            <p>

            </p> <br><br>

            This power supplier has sophisticated architecture, so not everything 
            was obvious. The next step was to draw a circuit of it. 
        </p>
        <h3>Power supply input and 3 phase current from a common electric plug</h3>
        <p>
            I started from the input. It has place for four cables - three of 
            them represent different phases, the last one is a neutral.
            
            <h4>Why do we get 3 phase AC current?</h4>
            <p>
                Physics behind electricity transmission makes passing DC current 
                on long distances unprofitable due big losses on hitting. AC current 
                has been using instead. <br><br>

                After some period of experimentations engineers worldwide came 
                to the concept of three phase electricity. It has several 
                advantages, where the most relevant for my aims is it makes 
                DC current afterwards more smooth (do you notice short gaps 
                between periods on the image below?) <br><br>

                <p>

                </p> <br><br>

            </p>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>
                Three phase AC power source transmit high voltage current over 
                wires. Near end user there is a transformer which converts high 
                voltage current to a specific voltage current required by end 
                user. For apartments it is 220V/280V. This voltage you can get 
                from a plug in your apartment. 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Physics behind current and electricity in general</h4>
            <p>
                Electricity is caused by movement of 'free' electrons and electron 
                holes. By electron hole implies lack of electron which should be 
                at that place. The absence of an electron behave itself in 
                current as a particle. This together with due to the 
                concentration of electrons and the concentration of their absence 
                have impact on the charge, the term 'electronic hole' is used. <br><br>

                Electrons (n) and electronic holes (p) during movement in the 
                conductor which is called p-n junction. <br><br>

                Concentration of electrons or of their holes creates a charge, 
                charge create a voltage which may produce current. <br><br>
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Capacitors: stabilize current</h3>
        <p>
            Capacitors are often used to stabilize a current. Either by spike 
            at current's source or due spike in circuits, e.g. voltage drop when 
            transistor just has been opened, current within circuit will 
            fluctuate, which will have negative impact on stable work of the 
            device. Capacitors <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/83929/356145">are used to</a> solve this issue. <br><br>
            
            <p>
                <img src="/blog/assets/images/2023-12-23/capacitor-with-scheme.png"/>
            </p> <br><br>
            
            Capacitors are not traced by multimeter. Multimeter might show 
            at once a resistance caused by some potential still charged by a 
            capacitor, but in general it should show anything. If a capacitor 
            is traced, it is too big leakage and should be replaced. 
        </p>
        <h3>Thermistors: the first line of protection</h3>
        <p>
            Thermistors are elements which start to provide current when 
            temperature of element has reached some threshold. In this 
            circuit they are used as a first line of the protection. They are 
            connected in parallel, if the high voltage current comes over input, 
            thermistor get shorted together with all circuit. Thermistor become 
            broken, but the rest of power supplier and a device it is connected 
            to will be safe <br><br>

        </p>
        <h3>Varistors: the second line of protection</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Diode bridge or 3 phase Larionov's rectifier: rectify current</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Filter</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Arrestor or gas tube charger: the third line of protection</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>There is no full guarantee to prevent your electronics break down due voltage jumps</h3>
        <p>
            As you see the first overview doesn't show any visible damage to the 
            power supply. The next step is to check with help of multimeter a 
            resistance between each key element of the circuit - it will show 
            an element is working. However such checks have shown all elements 
            of this multilines protection from voltages jumps are all fine, 
            they are working. It means they didn't help to protect the power 
            supply from breakage in this specific case.

        <h3>Induction coil: increase current</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Capacitors one-by-one: increase voltage to 800V</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Capacitors in parallel</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Transformer: convert high current to a required current</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Why do we need it?</h4>
            <p></p>
            <h4>How it works?</h4>

        <h3>Transistor: open or close different segments of circuit</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Combined transistors</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Pair of diodes</h3>
        <p>
            They looks as a transistor, but actually they are different element 
            and they have to be tested differently. It is important to check 
            each element specification
