        When I was a bit younger I had been preparing to university exams and 
        intensely study physics. <br><br> 

        When I faced with complex task I was surprised that the task seems to 
        don't have a solution can be easily solved when I changed system of 
        coordinates. When system of coordinates is changed the issue is 
        disappeared. <br><br>
        
        It is an interesting observation -- the presence or absence of the 
        problem depends on the system of coordinates. For people this system 
        of coordinates is their world view, their ideals and their values 
        (their culture). <br><br>
        
        We should keep it in mind when we communicate to another person our 
        problem. It is quite possible in his system of coordinates this problem 
        doesn't exist. <br><br> 
        
        The most important talk is a talk about definitions, values and ideals. <br><br>
