            Rising trend of hacker attacks on the business and government 
            organizations brings us to the necessity to do extra actions to 
            mitigate this risks. <br><br> 

            Top 3 vectors of hacker attacks: <br>
            1. Exploiting vulnerability in the system <br>
            2. Social engineering over employees of the organization <br>
            3. Misconfiguration of system within organization <br><br>
            
            All this three directions requires our attention right now which 
            means extra expenditures. How much would it cost? <br><br> 
            
            Public reports shown business lost from 500k to 3.8 millions USD 
            in average per attack. Of course, it doesn't cover incidents 
            which doesn't have prices, e.g. hacking attack on nuclear plant 
            with worldwide disaster. Nevertheless this numbers gives us some 
            upper bound on how much business find reasonable to spend on 
            their information security. <br><br> 
            
            Reports also shown current business expenditures on information 
            security are ~375k USD per year for large enterprises and ~38k 
            USD per year for small and medium businesses. Data doesn't give 
            us details, but likely the budget goes to buy and maintain 
            specialized InfoSec software, stuff training and penetration 
            testing of the organization. It should cover point 2 and 3 from 
            the top list above, but what should be done to cover the top most 
            popular vector of attacks? <br><br> 
            
            Professional community insists on extending software development 
            lifecycle (SDLC) by *secure* software development lifecycle (SSDLC). <br><br>

            Generally speaking it means applying several practices of 
            information security expert to each stage of software development: <br><br>
            
            Threat modelling at the design stage -> static analyzers and 
            security scanners at the development stage -> penetration testing 
            before the UAT stage. <br><br> 
            
            By my ballpark estimates it will increase costs of software 
            development by extra 25% by growing rates of SDE professionals and 
            total amount of hours spent on the project. Of course, customers 
            might continue develop their projects as is, but it would mean 
            continue ignoring the top â„–1 cause of losses due hacker attacks. <br><br>
