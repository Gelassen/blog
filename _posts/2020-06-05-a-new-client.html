        <p>
            Last month I spent in Singapore pair programming with team from pivotal 
            labs, successfully pass the trial and Coderbunker joins pool of trusted 
            vendors of our client. We continue work on the project from Shanghai. 
        </p>
        <h4>Tech stack and process</h4> 
        <p>
            Android native, JavaRx, Junit, Mockito, Espresso, dagger, git, TDD, Scrum <br /> <br />

            What makes this project interesting?<br /> <br />
            
            500k lines of code. 100+ Android engineers in Europe, North America and 
            Asia deliver it for 5 markets. 2 years of ongoing development and the 
            highest code quality of codebase I saw so far in mobile development. <br /><br />

            Client is under NDA. 
        </p>
        <h4>Who is the team?</h4>
        <p>
            Pivotal labs and our client team. Pivotal labs prefer rock bands over 
            rock stars to deliver high quality software. Instead of hunting to 
            hire rare famous 10x developers they focus to build teams and processes 
            which helps them sustainably deliver lasting customer value in long 
            run. 
        </p>
        <h4>What is the recipe of their success?</h4> 
        <p>
            Good corporate culture, pair programming, daily rotation, TDD, estimate 
            complexity over time, strict work-life balance and multiple time-breaks 
            during the day. 
        </p>
        <h4>Pair programming.</h4> 
        <p>
            In many industries professionals works in pairs to reduce risk of error, 
            e.g. jet pilots. Software engineers also can do this which increase 
            collaboration, helps to cover a big variety of edge cases that increase 
            quality of architecture decisions and gives benefits of permanent code 
            review 
        </p>
        <h4>Daily rotation.</h4> 
        <p>
            Each day they rotate pair: one of the members from pair goes to another 
            pair so everyone stay on the same stream no more than 2 days. It gives 
            everyone a whole codebase knowledge which again increase quality of 
            their architectural decisions. 
        </p>            
        <h4>TDD</h4>
        <p>
            They practice test-driven development. They really do this. The big 
            advantage of TDD is each new changes in codebase might broke something 
            in some place and tests helps you spot this place immediately. 
        </p>
        <h4>Complexity over time estimates.</h4>
        <p>
            They don’t estimate how long would it take to deliver this feature. 
            Instead they estimate it’s complexity in traditional story points. It 
            helps to focus on development of high quality code rather than deliver 
            features to the date with compromised quality under needs of current 
            moment. (*) 
        </p>
        <h4>Work-life balance and multiple breaks during work day.</h4>
        <p>
            Researches shows knowledge workers can not work efficiently more 6 
            hours per day. That's why it is important to find time for rest each 
            day to be productive tomorrow. With level of engagement required by 
            pair programming work-life balance become even more important. <br /><br />

            The question that takes my thoughts is does it only payoff in product companies? 
        </p>
        <p>
            * there is no information about how much features would be delivered 
            at the end of the month, there is no deadline - nightmare for 
            management! - but that's how it removes fear and stress from work and 
            focus on results. They mitigate risks by makes stories small as much 
            as possible to help management with planning. <br /><br />
