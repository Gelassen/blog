        <p>
            My experience tells that at a certain stage of growth, any business faces 
            the need to work in the Power (a government or networks\structures beyond 
            it), as its competitors or simply ill-wishers begin to use the state 
            apparatus and instruments of the Power to destroy or capture your business.

            The second point is the law of concentration of the capital. Political 
            economy's classics. The competitive market is something close to a myth: 
            it can be found in some particular examples, but everywhere I see monopolies 
            and quasi-monopolies.

            The third point is that the capitalism is about 400 years old. Monopolies 
            had been formed a long time ago. All or almost the entire economy of the 
            world (sic!) is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small group of 
            people, all links lead to Blackrock and Vanguard corporations.
