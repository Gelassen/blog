        We discover our environment not directly -- by mediators. This mediators 
        are our sensor feelings, cause-effect relationships, media etc. Through 
        this information channels we build in our head a model of the world 
        around. <br>
        The key factor here is exist\lack of feedback. This feedback (or the lack 
        of it) approve existing hypothesis in our head. It works really interesting 
        in social systems when people consciously and unconsciously distort 
        information or simply have two opposite opinions that are true at the 
        same time. We are looking for confirmation of our model of world in the 
        opinions of people around us. <br><br>
        
        There is no reality except that we communicated and agreed on. <br><br>
        
        That's why even quiet and humble people have to standing out and speak. Sadly, Japanese don't use LinkedIn <br><br>
