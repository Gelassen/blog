        We are, as a biologically species, constantly reacting in different ways, 
        and when we receive positive feedback from our environment, we start to 
        evolve in this direction and act in this way more often. <br><br>

        Companies live with two environment -- external, familiar for each of us 
        and internal, which is built to maintain the company's organization. 
        Employees of company might be on the surface with full exposure to the 
        external environment or might be deep inside the company hidden by layers 
        of hierarchy without any access to external environment. <br><br>
        
        One of the key leadership responsibilities is provide clear signal from 
        external environment to others.* It is not only help to make all actions 
        valuable for the company, but also adopt to the change of external 
        environment which can not be visible inside the company bubble. <br><br>
        
        By minimizing the buffer between users/customers and company employees we 
        avoid miscommunication, we create an environment where every action serves 
        interest of users/customers and adopt to their needs faster. <br><br>
        
        Minimizing layers to external environment helps everyone better understand 
        what's valuable for the customers&company and decrease resistance to 
        change to a new conditions. <br><br>
        
        Just thinking. <br><br>
        
        *Backward signal is also important-clear feedback from bottom to top <br><br>
