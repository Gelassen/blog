            Passed week I look through VPN specs, IEEE docs and implementations with intent to get better understanding it work and implement one. 

            Here is a summary of my research to put down outcome of it. 

            <br/><br/>

            In the nutshell VPNs wraps original packet in the new one. Origin packet is encrypted and becomes not avaiable for access when it comes through global network. 
            External packet provides source and destinations IPs for navigation and additional data that varies among protocols.  

            <br/><br/>

            The most popular protocols are SSTP, PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, IKEv2. 

            <br/><br/>

            Another issue is a response on things like Great China Firewall and others attempts to control web traffic. 

            <br/><br/>

            When I was living and working in China I got interesting insights on its work. Most of this things I forget, but basically they enabled 
            Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and bring machine learning to evaluate traffic that fall into censorship rules. It constantly evolving that 
            forces existing solutions to look for new ways to overcome new obstacles. 
            
            <br/><br/>

            From GoHop VPN I learn it changes protocols and ports with traffic morphing to make traffic misfit patterns censorship algorithms looks for. 
            There are many others ways to go through this which was interesting topic to explore and dificult project to work on without concrete 
            aim and constraints besides just curiosity. 

            <br/><br/>

            Known instruments to monitor traffic is DPI and statistic analysis by external parameters of the packet or its payload. I need more time to understand 
            how it works in details which is the key to find solution to escape it attention. Wright's approach to traffic shaping is the most referenced 
            across works I read <a link="https://www.academia.edu/1938523/Traffic_morphing_An_efficient_defense_against_statistical_traffic_analysis">Wirght's morphing</a>,
            but it needs more investigation across existing open source implementations (e.g. Shadowsocks or OpenVPN) 
            
            <br /><br />
